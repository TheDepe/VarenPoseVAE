## Description

Parametric 3D models driven by joints, typically suffer from the fact that joints are defined simply as rotation matrices with full 360-degrees of freedom. This often results in estimated poses that are simply not congruent with real-life physics. The VAREN model is not immune to these problems. To mitigate this, this repo provides a **VAE-based Pose-Prior**, capturing a very large pose space, across almost 1 million unique poses. The VAE takes as input a pose, and attempts to recreate it from the learned pose-space, effectively **regularising** unnatural poses into poses that are more plausible.

Additionally, this model allows for **sampling** from the learned pose-space - giving access to **realistic** poses without the need for extensive data capture and alignment procedures.

## Environment
This is a light-weight repo, so that it can be easily integrated into other codebases. 
The main requirements for using the model are just PyTorch and VAREN. Additional dependencies include tqdm for training / loading the data, and trimesh for visualisations/example scripts. 

They can all be installed via 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Known Issues:
Currently, with trimesh version 4.6, there is a bug in which mesh face colours are not properly applied. Simply downgrade trimesh as a work around. This will likely be fixed in the near future (by Trimesh).
Additionally, pyglet may need to be installed and/or downgraded to a version <2.0.
